## Student Management System
This Project is basic project which shows the use of List and Inheritance with for loop for storing and displaying multiple records without use of database in application. I have added Update and Delete operations too, so it is able be to perform CRUD operations in Python. You Can add, show, update and delete student in this project.  
I also added the GUI in this project using Tkinter, a built-in module in python.
